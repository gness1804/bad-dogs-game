This is a very preliminary version of a side-scrolling game that I hope to expand into something more complex. The avatar obviously needs a lot more work, as does the rest of the game. For instance, I need to figure out a way to do collision detection. But this is the beginning!

Reorganized internal folders and relocated the earlier version of the game to another directory.

Notes:

(output - 8), (output - 300); //standard position formula for Mal avatar
